# Audio-Analysis

- This is a project that I used to undedrstand sound engineering in Python using librosa.
- Further, tried to use the GTZAN genre dataset to classify songs based on genre, using librosa features (zero crossing, chroma stft, spectral centroid, spectral rolloff and spectral bandwidth)
- Can improve on the poor accuracy.
